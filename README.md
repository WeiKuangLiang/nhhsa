This repository consists of the software tool for the Holo-Hilbert spectral analysis (HHSA, in the folder hhsa_tools), and a minimum dataset with data from 20 participants during a visual working memory task (here, 3 IC channels obtained from ICA on their EEG data).
This dataset is organized by SPM12 format, therefore requiring SPM12 to retrieve the data in each file for further HHSA. 
Further details of the dataset will be added here once the related manuscript is accepted.
