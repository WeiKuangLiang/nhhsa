This repository consists of the software tool for the Holo-Hilbert spectral analysis (HHSA, in the folder hhsa_tools), and a minimum dataset with data from 20 participants during a visual working memory task (here, 3 IC channels obtained from ICA on their EEG data).
Further details of the dataset will be added here once the related manuscript is accepted.
